# Different command groups
Below you can see different command groups described for organising the commands

## Admin
These commands should be **hidden** from the guests and can be used to configure the bot and manage things in the background.

## Games
These commands are game specific which guests would **get access** while being allocated to the appropriate game

## Guest
These commands should be **always available** to the guests with which they can help themselves, get more information or entertain themselves.
